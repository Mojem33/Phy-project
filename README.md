Welcome 
Every developer knows HTML and CSS and must master their skills in it as well they needs to learn how to program browsers, databases and servers.
You have several choices in programming languages including JavaScript ,PHP and Python. In this case we would be paying attention to Python.

The most important file which we need to create is index.html , which is a default for evry web application.
The file suffix .html refers to Hypertext Markup Language known . HTML allows us to format webpages and text in a similar way to how a word processor formats documents and the text inside them. However, but the difference between those two is that HTML allows us to link between any document that's on the web, anywhere in the world. This is the "hypertext" in HTML.
Next file we need to create is style.css which is the content and placement director in newspapeer where to apply or on which page , the same work does CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) file for content any websites (...).
